# 🔊 Fourier Series Signal Analysis using MATLAB GUI

This project is an interactive **MATLAB GUI application** built for educational and analytical purposes. It allows users to **generate and analyze signals** (Rectangular, Triangular, and Chirp) with user-defined parameters like amplitude, duty cycle, and time shift. The tool computes **Fourier series coefficients** and visualizes both **time-domain waveforms** and **frequency-domain representations**.

## 📌 Features

- 🎛️ **GUI Interface** designed using MATLAB's GUIDE
- 📈 **Signal Plotting** (Rectangular, Triangular, and Chirp)
- 🧮 **Fourier Coefficient Calculation** (Analytical and Numerical)
- ⚙️ **Parameter Control** for:
  - Amplitude
  - Duty Cycle
  - Time Shift
- 🔁 Time shifting logic and waveform transformation
- ⚡ **FFT-based spectral analysis** for aperiodic signals (e.g., Chirp)

## 🧠 Signals Supported

- **Rectangular Signal**
- **Triangular Signal**
- **Chirp Signal** (Linear frequency sweep)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MATLAB (GUIDE)** for GUI development
- **MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox** for integration and Fourier series
- **Signal Processing Toolbox** (for FFT and analysis)
